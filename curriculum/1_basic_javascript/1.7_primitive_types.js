/**
 * In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data 
 * that is not an object and has no methods or properties.
 * 
 *  There are 7 primitive data types:
 * string
 * number
 * bigint
 * boolean
 * undefined
 * symbol
 * null
 * 
 * All primitives are immutable/অপরিবর্তনীয়; that is, they cannot be altered.
 * The variable may be reassigned to a new value, but the existing value can not be changed
 *  that objects, arrays, and functions can be altered.
 * The language does not offer utilities to mutate primitive values.
